And last I checked, we had some empty beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in their hearts. \nBrothers and sisters of the Circle, today we welcome a new soul into our mortal fold. This man has endured, has challenged, and has shown his valor. Who will speak for him? \nI worry that you've been spending too many nights out. \nHow goes the hunt? \nHow are the young ones coming along? \nWhen I was young, I favored huge swords, much like you. Hard to lift these days, but I still enjoy the heft of a good hammer. \nMy title is Harbinger, child. I am no man's master. \nDon't worry about such things. Just focus on your own honor. Bring glory to the Companions, and that glory will return upon you.",
